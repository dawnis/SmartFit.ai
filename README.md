# SmartFit.ai

## About
SmartFit.ai (http://smartfit.ai) is a virtual try-on and recommender service that I contributed to at Insight Data Science 2018 Session B. I developed the Flask app and recommender service, while Rohan Bhandari developed the virtual try-on, and Steve Xie acted as Product Manager.
